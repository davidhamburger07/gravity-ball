# 🌀 Gravity Ball

**A 2.5D physics puzzle game where you don't move the ball — you move the world.** Flip the
direction of gravity (Up / Down / Left / Right) to roll a ball through 200+ bite-sized puzzles.
Built as an HTML5 game for [CrazyGames](https://crazygames.com), optimized for desktop and mobile web.

  <em>Phaser 3 · Matter.js · Vanilla ES Modules · Zero-build local dev</em>

## 🎮 The Core Idea

Most platformers give you a *move* button. Gravity Ball gives you **one verb: shift gravity.**
The ball only ever responds to which way "down" currently is. Master momentum — because your
speed carries through every flip — and thread the ball past spikes, through portals, and into the goal.

## 🚀 Run it locally

No build step, no bundler — just Node for a static server (loading over `http://` is required
so ES modules and `fetch()` work; `file://` will not).

```bash
npm run dev          # → http://localhost:3000
# or:  node serve.mjs
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** and use **Arrow keys / WASD** (or swipe on a touch device) to shift gravity.

> Requires Node 18+. In dev, Phaser loads from a CDN and source runs as unbundled ES modules for an
> instant edit-refresh loop. The production build (below) vendors everything locally.

---

## 📦 Build & deploy (CrazyGames)

```bash
npm run build     # → dist/  (minified bundle + local Phaser, no external CDNs except the CG SDK)
npm run preview   # serve dist/ at http://localhost:3000 to test the exact upload
```

`build.mjs` bundles every ES module into one minified `dist/bundle.js` via **esbuild** (Phaser stays a
global from the vendored `phaser.min.js`), copies the level data, and writes a production `index.html`.
The CrazyGames SDK keeps loading from `sdk.crazygames.com` — the one external the platform requires.

**To publish:** zip the *contents* of `dist/` (so `index.html` sits at the zip root) and upload to the
[CrazyGames developer portal](https://developer.crazygames.com/). The whole build is ~1.2 MB (Phaser is
the bulk) and loads in a second. The production bundle is verified to solve all shipped levels identically
to dev (`node verify-levels.mjs http://localhost:3000 2`).

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project is built around **decoupled systems that communicate over Phaser's scene event bus**,
so input, the core mechanic, and feedback never reach into each other:

```
InputManager  ──(gravity:request)──►  GravityController  ──(gravity:changed)──►  Camera / Juice
  (raw input)                            (the mechanic)                            (feedback)
```

- **`GravityController`** — the single source of truth for "down." Applies the Matter world gravity
  vector; changing it snaps the force instantly while preserving every body's velocity (momentum carry-over).
- **`InputManager`** — maps keyboard + touch swipes to abstract direction requests. Contains **zero** physics code.
- **Level data is data** — `src/data/levels.json`, arrayed by chapter → level. Never hardcoded into scripts.
- **`CrazyGamesSDK`** — a defensive wrapper so the game behaves identically on-platform and on localhost (mock mode).

## 🕹️ Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `↑` / `W` · `↓` / `S` · `←` / `A` · `→` / `D` | Shift gravity Up / Down / Left / Right |
| Swipe (touch) | Shift gravity in the swiped direction |
| `R` | Restart level |

**Mobile:** plays in **portrait or landscape** — **swipe anywhere** on the screen to shift gravity.
Swipes are captured on `window` (not just the canvas), so they register even in the space around a
portrait-fit playfield. The canvas is centered with a dynamic-viewport (`100dvh`) layout over a
full-screen background, and a loading spinner covers the initial engine download. All in the
production bundle.

---

## 🛠️ Level Editor

A standalone visual editor at **`/editor.html`** (also linked from the main menu). Build levels the
same way they're authored in `levels.json`, then play them instantly.

- **Place any piece** — spawn, goal, walls, spikes, sticky pads, trampolines, keys, doors. Click for
  a default size or click-drag to draw a box; the grid snaps to 20px. Erase removes the piece under
  the cursor.
- **Configure** — spike/trampoline direction, key/door color, trampoline power, start gravity, par,
  hint, and whether the goal is locked behind a key.
- **▶ Playtest** — hands the level to the *real game* (via `localStorage` + `?playtest=1`) so it plays
  with full physics and juice; a work-in-progress autosaves so the round-trip is lossless.
- **Export / Import** — copy or download the level as `levels.json`-shaped JSON, or paste JSON back
  in to keep editing.

The editor shares the game's textures and reuses `GameScene` for playtesting, and is bundled into the
production build (`dist/editor.html`).

## 🧩 Mechanics roadmap

Difficulty ramps one idea at a time. Each chapter introduces 1–2 new mechanics and ends with a combination finale.

| Ch | Theme | New mechanic |
|----|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Ground Zero | 4-way gravity shift |
| 2 | Spike Fields | Static hazards |
| 3 | Bounce House | Trampolines + sticky walls |
| 4 | Locksmith | Keys & doors |
| 5 | Fragile Ground | Breakable blocks + weight zones |
| 6 | Wormholes | Momentum-preserving portals |
| 7 | Chromatic | Color switches |
| 8 | Time Warp | Slow-mo zones + lasers |
| 9 | Singularity | Black holes + local gravity reversal |
| 10 | Event Horizon | Capstone: limited gravity shifts |

Full details, the mechanics library, and game-feel spec live in [`docs/GDD.md`](docs/GDD.md).

## 🛠️ Tech decisions (the "why")

- **Phaser 3 over Unity WebGL / Godot** — Phaser ships a tiny runtime and cold-loads in a second or two,
  which is exactly what CrazyGames rewards. Unity WebGL builds are multi-megabyte and struggle on mobile web;
  Phaser is pure JS with a first-class 2D physics story.
- **Matter.js over Arcade physics** — real rolling, restitution, and momentum make the "flip and carry speed"
  fantasy feel great. A fixed timestep keeps puzzle solutions reproducible.
- **Vanilla ES modules, no bundler (yet)** — keeps the repo readable and the local loop instant. A production
  bundle step is a deliberate, separate milestone.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] Core 4-way gravity system + input (keyboard & swipe)
- [x] Data-driven levels + runnable Chapter 1 slice
- [x] Menu + Level-select scenes with star ratings & unlock progression
- [x] Save system (CrazyGames data module, localStorage fallback)
- [x] Ch.1 Ground Zero (4) · Ch.2 Spike Fields (20) · Ch.3 Bounce House (20) · Ch.4 Locksmith (20)
- [x] Juice pass — procedural audio, particle bursts, squash-and-stretch, parallax, mute
- [x] Production build (esbuild bundle + vendored Phaser) — upload-ready `dist/` for CrazyGames
- [x] Visual level editor with playtest round-trip + JSON export/import
- [ ] Chapters 5–10 mechanics + full level set

## 🧪 Tooling & QA

Every level and UI change is verified before commit — no "looks fine" guesses.

```bash
npm run shot                              # headless Canvas screenshot (visual QA)
node screenshot.mjs URL lbl --level=2-12  # jump to a level and capture it
node verify-levels.mjs URL 2              # play every Chapter-2 solution, assert each reaches the goal
```

`verify-levels.mjs` loads the real game, plays each level's embedded `solution` key-sequence with
physics-settle waits, and fails if the ball doesn't reach the goal — so an unsolvable level can't
slip in. All 64 shipped levels pass.
